    can be viewed form the menu.

ULTIMATE ASSIGNMENT

Added new character, vocalist, with distortion animation
for her special stun attack. Stuns stun enemies and show particle effects
on them.

Added drummer's rotating drumstick throw attack.

Added boss level and cutscene.

Fixed bug with background scrolling on different resolutions.

Made cutscenes less ugly on higher resolutions.

Cheats:
    You can enter debug mode as described above.
    In this mode, tap 'CTRL-0' to get to checkpoint 0, etc. But make
    sure to tap -- holding it down will repeatedly respawn you.
    Use 'V' to fire a godly acid attack. (But be careful if you are
    using a slow computer -- this attack is cpu-intensive due to naive
    collision detection.)
    In any mode you can also adjust the difficulty in the settings.
